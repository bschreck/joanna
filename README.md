joanna
======

Changes occurrences of words like "you, you're, honey, girl, baby, etc." of a .txt song lyric files into words like "The Joannas", and sings the lyrics


add the comand line type:

`python jChange.py [lyrics.txt]`
where `lyrics.txt` refers to a song lyrics file

this only works on Mac OS X for now (maybe other UNIX flavors?)
